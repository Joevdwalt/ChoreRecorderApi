# Introduction

This is a simple api that goes with the ChoreRecorder application for backend management.

## Development

You will need to have a mongo db instance to save data for the api to run.

### Running the application

Currently I use the following command to spin up an instance of the API that the app can consume

`dotnet run urls="http://10.0.0.54:5000" --project './ChoreRecoderApi/<projectname>`
